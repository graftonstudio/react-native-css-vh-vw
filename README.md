# react-native-css-vh-vw

A ditto of CSS `vw` and `vh` units - returns, in pixels, a percentage of the device's 
viewport width or height. 

## Install
`npm install react-native-css-vh-vw`

## Dependencies
`react-native-css-vh-vw` itself has no dependencies, but it _must_ be used within a
React Native project. The only React Native API that it relies on is [`Dimensions`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/dimensions), which has support all the way back to React Native's [first release](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.5/dimensions).
